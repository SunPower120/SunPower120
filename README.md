Here are some details about me:

ðŸ”­ I have over 15 years of experience in the field of civil engineering, with roles ranging from a projector to head of department in a civil engineering company. My coding journey started with developing small applications for Arduino.

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently studying Java at Codelex with an aim to become a proficient backend or full-stack developer. I have certifications in C++ from ProgrammingHub and have taken Python courses on SoloLearn. I have also finished introductory courses in JavaScript/TypeScript through Codelex.

ðŸ’¼ Check out my latest projects:
    RPSSE: A rock, paper, scissors, spock, lizard console game in Java.
    Flight Planner: An application for flights in Java using Spring Boot. Upcoming frontend and database are on the way!
    Prep Course Final: A compilation of work in JavaScript, including games like Snake, Tic Tac Toe, and Minesweeper. (Only game logic wo frontend).

ðŸ’¬ Ask me about my journey transitioning from engineering to coding, about Python, C++, or my ongoing experience with Java. I can also share some insights on building independent websites.

âš¡ Fun fact: When I am not coding, you can find me hiking, riding motorcycles, or traveling. I love exploring new technologies in my free time.
